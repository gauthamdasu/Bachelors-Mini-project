  2. Povides a tab feature, which when pressed gives suggestions about the word pressed and allows you to write from where you      left in the word.
  3. Search for the word in the dictionary.
  Other features include : 
  
      Provide simple security feature of taking input password and a userid name for a user to work in the editor
      Provide with a option of writing on to a file by checking each entered word with the word that present in the dictionary.
      A help command is present, which gives the user while using for some help in how to use the editor.
